# wise-photometri-for-starburst
In this code, candidate starburst galaxies obtained through the ‘ALLWISE’ cross-match have been photometrically selected and plotted according to criteria that satisfy the conditions for being classified as starburst galaxies in the literature. I strongly recommend paying close attention to the reference criteria when adapting it to your own data.
